These portlets are being moved to their real places.

/contrib/portlets will contrain portlets that work portably across portals

/contrib/sakai-portlets will contain portlets that only work in Sakai

/svn/portlets will contain portlets that are intended to be *part* of the
Sakai distribution - at this point Sun Apr 15 10:35:23 EDT 2007
there are no portlets that are destined for the Sakai distribution.  
All portlets are contrib status.

So when the transition is complete - this directory will be empty..

portlet-util                   moved to /contrib/portlets
sakai-api-portlet              will move to /contrib/sakai-portlets
sakai-launch                   copied to /contrib/portlets
sakai-sample-portlets          moved to /contrib/portlets

sakai-launch is a portable portlet and is kept here in case folks 
are pointing at it in builds.   After a time it will be deleted.
